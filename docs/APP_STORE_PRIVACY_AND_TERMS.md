• To communicate with you (e.g. support, password reset).

## 三、在 App Store Connect 與 App 內填寫方式

### 1. Notion 發佈

1. 在 Notion 新增兩個頁面：「OnePop – Privacy Policy」「OnePop – Terms of Use」。
2. 分別貼上上面「一」「二」的內文（或你的版本）。
3. 各頁右上角 **Share** → **Publish to web** → 開啟 **Publish**。
4. 複製兩個網址（例如 `https://xxx.notion.site/Privacy-Policy-...`、`https://xxx.notion.site/Terms-of-Use-...`）。

### 2. App Store Connect

- 到該 App → **App 隱私**（App Privacy）或版本頁的 **隱私政策 URL**（Privacy Policy URL）。
- **隱私政策 URL** 貼上 Notion 隱私權政策頁的連結。
- 若欄位有「使用條款 URL」，貼上 Notion 使用條款頁的連結；若沒有，通常只要求隱私政策 URL。

### 3. App 內連結（lib/pages/me_page.dart）

- 將 **Privacy policy** 的 `https://example.com/privacy` 改為你的 **Notion 隱私權政策** 連結。
- 將 **Terms of use** 的 `https://example.com/terms` 改為你的 **Notion 使用條款** 連結。

這樣 App 隱私、App Store 申請與 App 內「隱私權政策／使用條款」就都對齊了。
